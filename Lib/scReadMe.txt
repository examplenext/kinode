My another software:

Programs:

BiCat - 
A utility for viewing, storing and cataloging small image files (glyphs). 
Bitmaps from BiCat may be used for program development (speedbuttons, toolbars) 
and WWW pages design (background, bullets, marks). It supports BMP, ICO, EMF 
and WMF formats. Saves disk space by storing all your glyph files in BiCat 
database. It helps to avoid cluster losses for small files. More than 
2000 glyphs (bitmaps and icons) are available for registered users.
Very convenience for programers. I'm using it with RxLib PicEdit 
(which has Copy/Paste buttons) and Delphi Image Editor in everyday 
programing practice.

HTML-View - 
Easy to use viewer for WWW file formats. Features: browse by file, file name 
as command line parameter, file and folder bookmarks, supports animated GIFs, 
search in files, file operations, and more. 
Requires installed MS Internet Explorer v3.01 or later

PicViewer - 
Image viewer for most common file formats. PicViewer displays images in 
the following formats: BMP, ICO, WMF, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, PCX, TIFF, PCD. 
Features: slide show, browse by image file, image file name as 
command line parameter, supports animated GIFs, bookmarks, file operations, 
image converter, and more.

old Win3.1-style TFileListBox (for Delphi 2 and Delphi 3).
